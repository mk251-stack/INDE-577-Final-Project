# Linear Regression – Census Income Dataset

In this project, I applied **Linear Regression** to the UCI Census Income dataset to explore how demographic and work-related features relate to income level.

I implemented the model **from scratch** and compared it to Scikit-learn’s built-in regression.

Key learning outcomes:
- Implemented OLS manually.
- Explored feature-target relationships visually.
- Conducted residual and cross-validation analysis.
